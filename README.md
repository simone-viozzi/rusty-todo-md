Rusty TODO MD helps you **find, centralize, and maintain** all your `TODO` comments across your codebase.
It can run as a **[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook** or from the **CLI**, automatically extracting TODO-style comments into a structured `TODO.md` file.

Supports a wide range of languages and file types, with **sectioned formatting**, **multi-line support**, and **smart sync**.

---

## üìå Recommended usage: Pre-commit via shim repo

When `pre-commit` installs a hook from a Git repo, it runs `pip install .` from that repo ‚Äî which would normally build Rusty TODO MD from source (requiring a Rust toolchain).

The **shim repository** ([`rusty-todo-md-pre-commit`](https://github.com/simone-viozzi/rusty-todo-md-pre-commit)) solves this by depending on the `rusty_todo_md` PyPI package, ensuring **prebuilt wheels** are used.

Add this to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/simone-viozzi/rusty-todo-md-pre-commit
    rev: v1.7.5  # Use the latest upstream tag (shim mirrors upstream)
    hooks:
      - id: rusty-todo-md
```

Then install the hook:

```sh
pre-commit install
```

> ‚úÖ No Rust toolchain is required when using the shim and a supported platform.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è CLI installation

You can also install Rusty TODO MD directly for manual CLI use:

```sh
pip install rusty_todo_md
```

Then run:

```sh
rusty-todo-md --help
```

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

1. **Automatic TODO Collection**
   By default, Rusty TODO MD scans your **staged files** (or all tracked files using the `--all-files` flag) for markers like `TODO` and `FIXME`, and updates your `TODO.md` with any new entries.

2. **Sectioned TODO.md Format**
   The `TODO.md` file is now organized into sections, grouped first by marker (e.g., `# TODO`, `# FIXME`), then by file. Each marker section begins with a header (`# <MARKER>`), each file with a sub-header (`## <file-path>`), followed by a list of extracted TODO items.

3. **Multi-line TODO Support**
   Handles multi-line and indented TODO comments, merging them into a single entry.

4. **Sync Mechanism**
   - Automatically merges new TODO entries with existing ones, using an internal representation.
   - Removes entries when their corresponding TODOs are no longer present in the source code.

5. **Language-Aware Parsing**
   Supports precise parsing for **Python**, **Rust**, **JavaScript**, and **Go** out-of-the-box, with plans for additional languages such as TypeScript, PHP, and Java.

6. **Seamless Pre-Commit Integration**
   Easily integrate Rusty TODO MD into your workflow by adding it to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

## üìù Supported languages & extensions

Rusty TODO MD detects comment syntax based on file extension:

| Language / Type    | Extensions                                       |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Python             | `py`                                             |
| Rust               | `rs`                                             |
| JavaScript / JSX   | `js`, `jsx`, `mjs`                                |
| TypeScript         | `ts`, `tsx`                                      |

| C / C++ headers    | `cpp`, `hpp`, `cc`, `hh`                          |
| C#                 | `cs`                                             |

| Shell              | `sh`                                             |
| YAML               | `yml`, `yaml`                                    |
| TOML               | `toml`                                           |
| Dockerfile         | `dockerfile`                                     |
| Markdown           | `md`                                             |

> Many extensions share the same parser (e.g., JS-style comment parsing for TS, Java, C-like languages).

---

## üîç Output format (stable)

Entries in `TODO.md` use this format:

```
* [path/to/file.ext:LINE](path/to/file.ext#L{LINE}): MESSAGE
```

This format is stable and designed for easy linking to code in hosted repos.

Example:

```
# TODO
## src/main.rs
* [src/main.rs:10](src/main.rs#L10): Refactor initialization logic
```

## üì¶ Requirements & Supported Platforms

- **Python** ‚â• 3.10
- **No Rust toolchain** needed if using the shim or PyPI wheels

Prebuilt wheels are published for:

| OS / libc         | Architectures                           |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Linux (manylinux)** | `x86_64`, `x86`, `aarch64`, `armv7`, `ppc64le` |
| **Linux (musllinux)** | `x86_64`, `x86`, `aarch64`, `armv7`          |
| **Windows**           | `x64`, `x86`                               |
| **macOS**             | `x86_64` (macOS 13), `aarch64` (macOS 14)  |

---

## üõ† Troubleshooting

- If no wheel is available for your platform, `pip` will try to build from source ‚Äî which **requires a Rust toolchain**.
- If you encounter build errors, please:
  1. Check the [latest releases](https://github.com/simone-viozzi/rusty-todo-md/releases) to confirm wheel availability.
  2. Open an [issue](https://github.com/simone-viozzi/rusty-todo-md/issues) with your OS/arch details.

---

## üë©‚Äçüíª Development

If you want to run Rusty TODO MD directly from the main repo via pre-commit (building from source):

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/simone-viozzi/rusty-todo-md
    rev: v1.7.5
    hooks:
      - id: rusty-todo-md
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This will compile the Rust source and requires a working Rust toolchain.
