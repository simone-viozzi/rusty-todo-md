# **Rusty TODO MD** ‚Äî A Pre-Commit Hook for Managing TODOs

Rusty TODO MD is a **pre-commit hook** designed to help you manage and centralize all your code's **TODO** comments by automatically extracting them and synchronizing them into a single **`TODO.md`** file. With support for multiple languages‚Äîcurrently Python and Rust‚ÄîRusty TODO MD now organizes TODOs using a new sectioned format for enhanced readability and easier maintenance.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

1. **Automatic TODO Collection**  
   By default, Rusty TODO MD scans your **staged files** (or all tracked files using the `--all-files` flag) for markers like `TODO` and `FIXME`, and updates your `TODO.md` with any new entries.

2. **Sectioned TODO.md Format**  
   The `TODO.md` file is now organized into sections, with each section corresponding to a source file. Each section begins with a header (`## <file-path>`) followed by a list of extracted TODO items.

3. **Multi-line TODO Support**  
   Handles multi-line and indented TODO comments, merging them into a single entry.

4. **Sync Mechanism**  
   - Automatically merges new TODO entries with existing ones, using an internal representation.
   - Removes entries when their corresponding TODOs are no longer present in the source code.

5. **Language-Aware Parsing**  
   Supports precise parsing for **Python** and **Rust** out-of-the-box, with future plans for additional languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript, and Go.

6. **Seamless Pre-Commit Integration**  
   Easily integrate Rusty TODO MD into your workflow by adding it to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

## üöÄ Objective

Scattered TODO comments can be hard to track and maintain. Rusty TODO MD centralizes these comments in a structured, sectioned `TODO.md` file‚Äîmaking it simpler to review outstanding tasks and keep your documentation in sync with your codebase.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Pre-Commit
If you haven't already installed [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/):
```sh
pip install pre-commit
```
*(Alternatively, use your preferred package manager.)*

### 2. Configure Pre-Commit
Add the following snippet to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file at the root of your repository:
```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/your-username/rusty-todo-md
    rev: v0.1.8-alpha.11
    hooks:
      - id: rusty-todo-md
```
Replace `rev` with the desired tag or commit hash.

### 3. Install the Pre-Commit Hook
Run the following command from your repository root:
```sh
pre-commit install
```
Rusty TODO MD will now run on your staged files each time you commit.

---

## üß© CLI Usage (Optional)

You can also run Rusty TODO MD manually:
```sh
rusty-todo-md --all-files
```
- **`--all-files`**: Scans all tracked files instead of just the staged ones.

Or specify a custom location for your TODO file:
```sh
rusty-todo-md --todo-path docs/TODOS.md
```

---

## üìù How It Works

1. **File Discovery**  
   - By default, scans the staged files in your Git index.
   - With the `--all-files` flag, scans all tracked files in the repository.

2. **Comment Extraction**  
   - Parses file comments (ignoring code or string literals) to extract markers like `TODO` and `FIXME`.
   - Supports multi-line and indented comment structures.

3. **Sectioned TODO.md Format**  
   - Organizes extracted TODOs into sections based on the source file.
   - Each section starts with a header (`## <file-path>`) followed by formatted entries:
     ```
     * [<file-path>:<line_number>](<file-path>#L<line_number>): TODO message
     ```

4. **Sync Mechanism**  
   - Reads the existing `TODO.md` using the new parser.
   - Merges new TODO entries with the existing ones using an internal representation.
   - Writes the updated, sectioned list back to `TODO.md`.

---

## üîß Configuration

- **Markers**: Currently, the tool searches for `TODO` by default. You can customize markers (e.g., `FIXME`, `HACK`) in future configurations or CLI options.
- **Language Support**: Rusty TODO MD provides built-in parsing for Python and Rust, with planned support for additional languages.

## üìö Example

### Python Example
```python
# TODO: Implement data validation
def process_data(data):
    """
    FIXME: Optimize this logic
        Possibly reduce nested loops
    """
    pass
```
This produces a section in `TODO.md` like:
```
## path/to/your_file.py
* [path/to/your_file.py:2](path/to/your_file.py#L2): Implement data validation
* [path/to/your_file.py:4](path/to/your_file.py#L4): Optimize this logic Possibly reduce nested loops
```

### Rust Example
```rust
// TODO: Refactor main function
fn main() {
    /*
       FIXME: Add error handling
           Possibly a custom result type
    */
}
```
This produces a section in `TODO.md` like:
```
## src/main.rs
* [src/main.rs:2](src/main.rs#L2): Refactor main function
* [src/main.rs:5](src/main.rs#L5): Add error handling Possibly a custom result type
```
