* [src/todo_md_internal.rs:36](src/todo_md_internal.rs#L36): this logic seams to be wrong, why only add new items if they are not already present? what about removing items that are not present in the new collection? given that this is divide by file we can just replace the entry for a file with the new one
* [src/todo_md_internal.rs:88](src/todo_md_internal.rs#L88): add more tests for the merge of the collections - test that items are added if they are not already present - test that items are not duplicated - test that items are not removed - test that items are removed if they are not present in the new collection
